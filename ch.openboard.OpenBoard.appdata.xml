      <description>
        <p>New Features</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a progression bar at OpenBoard's launch.</li>
          <li>Restored complete support of PDF (1.0 to 1.4 versions) at export and permitted partial support of versions above (1.5 to 1.7) : a bug introduced in 1.5.2 was preventing the use of this method for versions 1.0 to 1.4. Also, previously, exported PDF pages were flattened as high resolution images, if the initial version of the PDF was &gt; 1.4 or if an error occured during export.</li>
          <li>exported PDFs are now much lighter, and text in the exported PDF is searchable again.</li>
          <li>if an error occurs during the export, previous method (flattened images of each page) is used.</li>
          <li>Added several messages to notify the users of what's happening during long operations</li>
          <li>It is now possible to double-click on an OpenBoard document (<code>.ubz</code>)  to launch OpenBoard and open the document directly, on every officially supported platform</li>
          <li>Doubled the size of the arrows in Desktop Mode, making it easier to click on them with a stylus, thanks to @temaps</li>
          <li>Updated Russian translations of GraphMe, thanks to @temaps</li>
          <li>Updated Polish translations, thanks to @marcin-serwin</li>
